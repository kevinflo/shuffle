A randomizer for timed pairings of meetup attendes. Written during TechCrunch 2014's disrupt hackathon.

READ THIS CODE AT YOUR OWN PERIL.  It was fueled by sleep deprivation and hunger and fatigue and uncomfortable chairs and a very cold empty hangar and was written in a single night.  It is not good.  The app is not fully functional

I'm still going to leave it on github because why not.
